# **About**
Atomic is a header only modern C++ library. It currently contains linear-algebra, geometry and general mathematical functions not present within the standard library. It aims to be lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects with low overhead using a variety of modern C++ features and practices. It is currently structured as split into 'modules' these are purely organisational, do not confuse these with c++ modules. Each module aims to be independent however all depend upon the core module. This library aims to be easy to use and all you have to do is simply include the .hpp files into your project no source file compilation is required.
