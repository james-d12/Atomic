# **About**
Atomic is a header only modern C++ library. It currently contains linear-algebra, geometry and general mathematical functions not present within the standard library. It aims to be lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects with low overhead using a variety of modern C++ features and practices. It currently covers the following major areas:

- Geometry
- Linear Algebra
- Containers
- Other Mathematical Functions
